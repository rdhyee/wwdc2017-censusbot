# Purpose of this wikidata bot

(2017.03.11) I'm seeking permission for [User:RaymondYeeBot - Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:RaymondYeeBot) to make corrections to [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page). 

I would like to start by correcting the [point in time](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P585) qualifications to the [population](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P1082) of US states according to the US 2010 Census. [A SPARQL query to show populations of US states in 2010](http://tinyurl.com/zovzu9l) shows that some of the date tied to populations for 2010 are January 1, 2010.  The dates from 2010 census should instead be [April 1, 2010](https://hyp.is/pEHXDgauEeeVM2OQ5k0Saw/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_States_Census).  This code will correct the dates for the US States. 

Once the date qualifications are fixed for the states, I would like to check and correct the dates for other geographic entities in the US.

This work was started for this[Wikipedia Data Design Challenge 2017](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/wikipedia-data-design-challenge-2017-tickets-31783891475).
